    <h1>Hand In My Pocket</h1>
    <h3>by Alanis Morsette</h3>
    <p id="myLyrics">I'm broke but I'm happy, I'm poor but I'm kind<br>
    I'm short but I'm healthy, yeah<br>
    I'm high but I'm grounded, I'm sane but I'm overwhelmed<br>
    I'm lost but I'm hopeful, baby<br>
    What it all comes down to<br>
    Is that everything's gonna be fine, fine, fine<br>
    'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket<br>
    And the other one is giving a high five<br>
    I feel drunk but I'm sober, I'm young and I'm underpaid<br>
    I'm tired but I'm working, yeah<br>
    I care but I'm restless, I'm here but I'm really gone<br>
    I'm wrong and I'm sorry baby<br>
    What it all comes down to<br>
    Is that everything is going to be quite alright<br>
    'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket<br>
    And the other one is flicking a cigarette<br>
    What it all comes down to<br>
    Is that I haven't got it all figured out just yet<br>
    'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket<br>
    And the other one is giving a peace sign<br>
    I'm free but I'm focused, I'm green but I'm wise<br>
    I'm hard but I'm friendly, baby<br>
    I'm sad but I'm laughing, I'm brave but I'm chicken shit<br>
    I'm sick but I'm pretty baby<br>
    And what it all boils down to<br>
    Is that no one's really got it figured out just yet<br>
    I've got one hand in my pocket<br>
    And the other one is playing the piano<br>
    And what it all comes down to, my friends, yeah<br>
    Is that everything is just fine fine fine<br>
    I've got one hand in my pocket<br>
    And the other one is hailing a taxi cab<br></p>
